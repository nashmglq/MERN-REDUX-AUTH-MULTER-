what is redux??

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications that helps you manage and share application data in a predictable way.


Basically it is like a big toy box that keeps all your toys (data) in one place, making it easy to find and use them whenever you want.

Three parts = Actions, Reducer, Constant

Action = describes what happened and communicates with the middleware, which can then interact with the server
it is also where the code knows who is triggered 
EX. so when a user press a button the action will ask the server to provide the action for that

Reducer: it holds the state. The reducer checks the action type (like request, success, or fail) to determine how to update the state. 


Constant: provides name or labels for actions (WHCIH HELP WITH COMMUCATION AND EXPORTING )

EXAMPLE

User clicks a button.

ACTION: Describes what happened and sends this information to the middleware, which may then communicate with the server.

REDUCER: Holds the state and uses different cases to return the updated state based on the received actions.
